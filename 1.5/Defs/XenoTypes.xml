		<label>Highborn</label>
		<description>Speculated to be the older, endogenic cousins of highmates, the highborn are seemingly tailor-made to thrive in the high societies of the galaxy. Beautiful, socially adept and yet surprisingly martial, they are equally able to charm with their mastery over the spoken word and impress with the skill with the rapier. Armed with so many advantages, the highborn have a tendency to be haughty and greedy, feeling entitled to the greatest luxuries and the finest bedmates.\n\nBut it is neither their social graces or martial skill that distinguishes the highborn the most, but their mysterious ability to cheat death. With it, no duel to the death over spurred honor has to be their last, nor any tense negotiations turned sour spell the end of their career.</description>
